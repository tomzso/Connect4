# Connect4 Game

Connect4 is a classic two-player connection game in which the players first choose a color and then take turns dropping colored discs into a seven-column, six-row vertically suspended grid. The pieces fall straight down, occupying the lowest available space within the column. The objective is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four of one's own discs.
